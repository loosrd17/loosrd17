- 👋 Hi, I’m @loosrd17.  I was in B2B sales for over 16 years, mainly in advertising and live events for alternative investment firms, but also worked with a large quantity of the Fortune 500 while selling multi-platform ad campaigns for Bloomberg.  My next to last job in sales was in SaaS/PaaS, which I did for 2 years.  I am now changing careers because even though I made a decent living at sales, it was not something I ever looked forward to doing. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Big Data, Cloud Computing, Data Mining, financial analysis, Data Science, analytics, financial analysis, Python, R, Statistics, Relational database, certifications, getting an entry-level job in the data science or business intelligence fhê
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science at NJIT, with a specialization in Data Visualization.  I am also pursuing a data analytics and 2 AWS certifications, which I hope to complete by June 2023.  My M.S. will not be complete until 08/2024.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...if you hear of any internships or even the most basic job in the data science or business intell department at your, or another, company, please reach out.  I do not care of it's just data entry into Excel or Tableau to get started.  Thanks.  Also, I would be happy to collaborate on studying.  This coming semester I am taking Applied Statistics and Data Visualization and Interpretation.  And this past semester, I took Web Application Systems.  So, if we can help each other, or study together, that'd be great
